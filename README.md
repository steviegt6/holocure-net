Fun little passion project I'm working.

## Projects

Several different projects with varying purposes are unified here.

| Project                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HoloCure.Registry`    | Minecraft-like registry system.                                                                                                                             |
| `HoloCure.Logging`     | Simple and extendable logging library.                                                                                                                      |
| `HoloCure.EventBus`    | Relatively speedy EventBus implementation.                                                                                                                  |
| `HoloCure.Loader`      | Abstractions for loading assemblies at runtime as if they were project dependencies (including support for resolving their NuGet and project dependencies). |
| `HoloCure.Reflection`  | Powerful tools for quick-and-easy reflection and method generation at runtime.                                                                              |
| `HoloCure.Core`        | Very rough "game framework", mostly featuring some abstractions and frameworks build upon FNA.                                                              |
| `HoloCure.NET`         | A rough port of [HoloCure](https://kay-yu.itch.io/holocure) build on `HoloCure.Core`.                                                                       |
| `HoloCure.NET.Desktop` | Various desktop-specific implementations designed to allow `HoloCure.NET` to run in a desktop environment.                                                  |
